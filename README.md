# maintenance-demo

This repo based on Spring Pet Clinic at [Spring Boot 2.2.0 commit](https://github.com/spring-projects/spring-petclinic/commit/ce7c3f93deb53798e3842e583fecea3514e90f1e). It demonstrates how to semi-automate some maintenance tasks. 

My [talk about maintenance](https://github.com/sparsick/maintenance-talk) is based on it.

The master branch contains all maintenance steps at whole. Look at the commit history to look on the maintenance steps.
